# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview
This is my first machine learning project where I'm working with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict survival outcomes from the disaster.

## Project Contents
- `data/`: Dataset directory.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with analysis.
- `models/`: Directory for storing model files.
- `outputs/`: Output figures and tables.

## Objective
To learn and apply machine learning techniques on the Titanic dataset to predict survival.
